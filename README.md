# Centralized-CheckPost
This project replaces traditional handwritten police checkpoint logs with a digital dashboard that enables secure data entry, real-time analytics, and SQL-powered search. Built with Streamlit, MySQL, and Python, it empowers officers to log, query, and summarize checkpoint activity with ease.

## Requirements

 2. MYSQL
 
 3. Streamlit

 ## Steps to run the application
i) Download Python (.py) named 'police_check_post.py' file.
